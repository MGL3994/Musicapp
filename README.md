# Musicapp

On this repo I'm working on porting a music app I developed some years ago to replace the default app with a music center one. I did learn some iOS dev but not worked with it for some time and since the old one uses pre swift3 code I'm writing the new one from the ground up and hoping to learn swiftUI.
